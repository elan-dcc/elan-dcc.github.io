# Joost van Son

**Position:** Relationship Manager 

**Specialization:** Stakeholder management 

**Role within ELAN:** Member of the core committee 

Originally, I was trained in finance and have worked extensively in project-based roles. As a grant advisor, I spent five enjoyable years supporting researchers with their funding applications. I particularly enjoyed translating numbers into practical insights and exploring how they could contribute to a better understanding of processes.  

My current role as relationship manager at ELAN allows me to combine my passion for connecting people and data. I also help explore how collected data can be used to improve processes in primary healthcare.  

In my free time, I love being on the dance floor as an instructor, with a passion for sharing energy, rhythm, and confidence to get everyone moving. I also enjoy heading into nature for long walks or spontaneous outdoor activities. One of my biggest dreams is to one day swim among hammerhead sharks. 

**Working days:** Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
