# Brenda M. Schakenbos

**Position:** Data Manager

**Specialization:** Patient-related research (NB: “patiëntgebonden onderzoek” kan letterlijk zo vertaald worden, maar internationaal wordt vaak patient-centered research of patient-oriented research gebruikt. Ik licht dit hieronder toe.)

**Role within ELAN:** Member of the core committee

In 2009, I started as a research assistant in a large study on frailty in older adults. I currently work as a data manager at the research center of PHEG, where we advise and support researchers in the practical design and execution of their studies. This ranges widely: from brown paper sessions at the start of a study to digitizing the study file at the end. As a data manager, I also assist researchers with creating Data Management Plans, building databases in Castor and Access, and managing study administration in Panama.

I live in Warmond with two tomcats. In my spare time, I love being outdoors! I enjoy long-distance hikes (preferably multi-day), cycling (often with a tent packed on the bike), and (vegetable) gardening.

**Working days:** Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday
