# Dr. Dennis O. Mook-Kanamori 

**Position:** Associate Professor

**Specializations:** General practitioner–epidemiologist; big data epidemiology

**Role within ELAN:** Head of ELAN; Chair of the steering committee, scientific board, and management team

After completing my PhD in Rotterdam and my General Practice training in Leiden, I combined my passion for research with my desire to help patients. These days, I work four days a week as a researcher and clinical epidemiologist at LUMC and one day a week as a general practitioner in Lisse. In addition, I enjoy doing shifts at the general practitioner out-of-hours clinics in Voorhout and Leiderdorp.

Within ELAN, I am one of the principal investigators and contribute to the continuous development of our multidimensional data infrastructure. What inspires me most is receiving a research question directly from a patient and then exploring it in depth across the various data sources. As a lecturer in Population Health Management and head of the Academic Collaborative Center for Primary Care LUMC (Academische Werkplaats Huisartsenzorg LUMC), I also hope to pass this passion on to young doctors and researchers.

I live in the Leiden region. In my free time, I enjoy traveling, cooking, and spending time with my family. When the weather is good, I like to fire up the barbecue with a glass of wine. I used to keep chickens — at one point as many as 40! But when we got two Bengal tomcats, they found the chickens a little too tasty…

**Working days:** Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday
