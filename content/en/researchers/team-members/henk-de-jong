# MSc Henk de Jong

**Position:** Functional Application Manager

**Specialization:** Data management

**Role within ELAN:** Member of the Data Competence Center

After completing a Master’s in Psychology at Leiden University, I ended up in IT. Initially, I worked for commercial companies as an Oracle consultant, followed by a period as a freelancer. When our children were born, frequent travel and changing jobs became less practical, and I joined LUMC in a permanent position.

Within ELAN, I manage the data for the ELAN-GP data warehouse (one of our two general practitioner data registries). In practice, this involves collecting, processing, and providing GP data for research purposes and healthcare innovation.

I was born “down under” in Australia, grew up in Delft, and moved to Leiden for my studies, where I have remained. I have been married to my wife Daniela for 35 years, and we have two daughters. Renovating our house is not really a hobby, but it takes up a fair amount of time. The same goes for our 250 m² vegetable garden, which I do consider a true hobby. I also enjoy taking vacations to less conventional locations and/or to the mountains.

**Working days:** Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
