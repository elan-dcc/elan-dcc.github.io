# Drs. Willian J. van Dijk

**Position:** Researcher

**Specialization:** Digital Health

**Role within ELAN:** Member of the core committee

After completing my medical degree, I spent a year working in intensive care. Following that, I conducted research on the COVID-19 pandemic. Using an app, we attempted to predict when a peak in COVID-19 patients might occur at general practitioners' offices. Additionally, we documented post-COVID conditions and conducted research on thrombosis following the COVID-19 vaccinations. At the same time, I am a resident in general practice and expect to complete my training in 2027.

Within ELAN, I supervise submitted research proposals. Additionally, I conduct research on the integration of data usage in general practitioner training and the retention of job satisfaction within primary care.

I live in Vlaardingen with my wife and two children, Jelle and Lotte. I play the piano and occasionally go for a run.

**Working Days:** Tuesday, Friday
