# Dr. Margot W.M. de Waal

**Position:** Assistant Professor

**Specialization:** Routine care data in geriatric medicine research

**Role within ELAN:** Chair of the core committee, member of the steering committee

After my studies in Health Sciences (specializing in epidemiology), I worked as a researcher at NIVEL and LUMC and completed my doctoral research. Collaboration with the field and relevance to everyday practice have always been a central focus. Additionally, I have thoroughly enjoyed holding a coordinating role in academic collaboration with general practitioners in the region, particularly in the areas of patient-centered research and research utilizing routine care data.

In recent years, my contributions to scientific research have focused primarily on vulnerable older adults, with collaborations at the LUMC Centre for Geriatric Medicine (LUMC Centrum voor Ouderengeneeskunde, LCO) and the UNC-ZH.

I live with my husband Eric in Leiderdorp. I am the mother of two adult children who have already moved out. Singing is one of my greatest hobbies. I also enjoy doing puzzles. Additionally, we often go out with our dog or friends.

**Working Days:** Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday
