# Dr. Rutger A. Middelburg

**Position:** Assistant professor

**Specialism(s):** Transfusiegeneeskunde; gebruik van routine zorgdata in onderzoek

**Role within ELAN:** Lid van het kernteam en de stuurgroep

After a Master’s in Biomedical Sciences and a PhD in clinical epidemiology, I spent nearly ten years conducting research in transfusion medicine. I have worked for various medical ethics review boards and served as an editor at the Dutch Medicines Bulletin. I have been teaching since 2007 and, since 2020, I have been affiliated with the Department of Population Health and Primary Care (PHEG).

I currently serve on the ELAN core team, act as module and track coordinator in the Master’s in Population Health Management [Comment: Dutch 'blok- en trackcoördinator'; confirm preferred terminology ('module and track coordinator' vs 'course/block coordinator')], and supervise students and PhD candidates in general practice research [Comment: 'huisartsgeneeskundig onderzoek'; 'primary care research' is also possible]. A common thread throughout my research is the consistent use of routine healthcare data.

I live in Oegstgeest with my wife and two children. In my spare time I enjoy sports—cycling, speed skating, diving, swimming, and running. Other hobbies include photography, reading, and writing.

**Working days:** maandag, dinsdag, donderdag, vrijdag
