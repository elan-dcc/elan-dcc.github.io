# Dr. Rutger A. Middelburg

**Position:** Assistant professor

**Specialism(s):** Transfusion medicine; usage of routine healthcare data in research

**Role within ELAN:** Member of the core team and of the steering committee

After a Master’s in Biomedical Sciences and a PhD in clinical epidemiology, I spent nearly ten years conducting research in transfusion medicine. I have worked for various medical ethics review boards and served as an editor at the Dutch Medicines Bulletin (know as Geneesmiddelenbulletin, or Ge-Bu). I have been teaching since 2007 and, since 2020, I have been affiliated with the Department of Population Health and Primary Care (PHEG).

I currently serve on the ELAN core team, act as module and track coordinator in the Master’s program Population Health Management, and supervise students and PhD candidates in primary care research. A common thread throughout my research is the consistent use of routine healthcare data.

I live in Oegstgeest with my wife and two children. In my spare time I enjoy sports like cycling, speed skating, diving, swimming, and running. Other hobbies include photography, reading, and writing.

**Working days:** Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday
