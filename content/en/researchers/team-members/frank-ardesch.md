# Frank Ardesch, MSc

**Position:** Researcher, data manager

**Specialization:** Data management

**Role within ELAN:** Member of the Data Competence Center

Since January 2019, I have been working as ELAN data manager. In this role, I manage data originating from various sources, which is linked to Statistics Netherlands (CBS) microdata, and make these datasets available to other researchers. This work contributes to the availability and usability of data for scientific research.

In 2023, I began my doctoral research project, focusing on the use of observational data within the Learning Health System (LHS) framework, with Population Health Management (PHM) as the guiding principle. I enjoy working in a structured and goal-oriented way and take great satisfaction in what I do â€” while also trying to leave room for humor and perspective along the way.

I live with my family in Delft. Whenever possible, I like to travel to Italy. In my free time, I enjoy playing tennis and can often be found on the (indoor) football field or playing padel. I also greatly enjoy watching sports matches and events. For me, sport is the ultimate way to clear my head and stay active.

**Working days:** Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday
