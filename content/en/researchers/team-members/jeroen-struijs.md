# Prof. Dr. Jeroen N. Struijs

**Position:** Professor by special appointment

**Specialization:** Alternative payment models; the use of observational data in (policy) evaluations

**Role within ELAN:** Head of ELAN; member of the core committee

After completing several programs in health care, I obtained my PhD at the Department of Social Medicine of the University of Amsterdam. Following several years of work as a physiotherapist, I became a researcher at the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), after which I held various research positions both in the Netherlands and abroad. Since 2005, my research has focused on the development, implementation, and evaluation of payment reforms.

I was involved in the founding of ELAN and continue to serve as its head. My time is divided between LUMC/Health Campus The Hague, the Dutch Healthcare Authority (NZa), and Bundle.

I am married, have two children, and live in The Hague. My work is also my hobby, but football is what I consider lifeâ€™s most important side issue. On weekends, I enjoy watching Sparta Rotterdam.

**Working days:** Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
