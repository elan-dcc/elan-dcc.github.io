# Prof. Dr. Erik J. Giltay

**Position:** Professor Psychiatric Epidemiology, Psychiatrist 

**Specialization:** Psychiatric Epidemiology 

**Role within ELAN:** Member of the management team 

I work as a psychiatrist at the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) and as an epidemiologist at the Health Campus in The Hague. I also teach medical students and supervise medical residents in training, with a focus on geriatric psychiatry. Besides this, I hold a position as visiting professor at the University of Antwerp. 

Within ELAN, I work with my team on mapping waiting lists and referral pathways by linking new data sources and improving data management in mental healthcare. This aligns with three funding programs: Nationaal Plan Hoofdzaken, BREN Zuid-Holland, and the GGZ Research Program on Waiting Lists (De Wachttijdstudie). 

I live with my partner in Gouda and work in Leiden and The Hague. In my free time, I enjoy reading a good book in the garden, having a fresh egg from one of our chickens, playing the piano, hosting house concerts, traveling, cooking (especially Indonesian), and sharing that with friends. 

**Working days:** Thursday, Friday
