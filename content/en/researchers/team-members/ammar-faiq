# Drs. M. Ammar Faiq

**Position:** Researcher, data scientist

**Specializations:** Dashboards; data-driven solutions

I hold a degree in Engineering Physics with a strong interest in healthcare and medical applications. My technical foundation was further strengthened through a Masterâ€™s in Engineering and Policy Analysis at TU Delft, specializing in Data Science. Before transitioning into research, I worked as a Web/Software Developer, gaining hands-on experience in programming and system development.  

Currently, I am a Researcher at LUMC, where I combine my expertise in data science, engineering, and Public Health to contribute to innovative medical studies and policy-relevant analyses. 

Originally from Indonesia, I enjoy hands-on hobbies that blend creativity with technical challenges. My free time is spent on board gaming and miniature painting, where strategy meets meticulous craftsmanship, as well as immersive sim racing and VR gaming experiences. I particularly enjoy PC building, where I get to combine hardware knowledge with performance optimization.
