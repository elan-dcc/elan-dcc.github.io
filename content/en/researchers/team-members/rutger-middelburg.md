# Dr. Rutger A. Middelburg

**Position:** Assistant professor

**Specializations:** Transfusion medicine; Usage of routine healthcare data in research

**Role within ELAN:** Member of the core committee and of the steering committee

After a Master’s in Biomedical Sciences and a PhD in Clinical Epidemiology, I spent nearly ten years in transfusion medicine research. I worked for two medical ethics review boards and still work as an editor at the Dutch Medicines Bulletin (Geneesmiddelenbulletin, or Ge-Bu). I’ve been teaching since 2007 and been affiliated with the Department of Population Health and Primary Care (PHEG) since 2020. 

I’m currently a member of the ELAN core committee and a module and track coordinator in the Master’s program Population Health Management. I also supervise students and PhD candidates in primary care research. A common thread in my research is the use of routine healthcare data. 

I live in Oegstgeest with my wife and two children. In my spare time I enjoy sports like cycling, speed skating, diving, swimming, and running. Other hobbies include photography, reading, and writing.

**Working days:** Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday
