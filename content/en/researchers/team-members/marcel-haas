# Dr. Marcel R. Haas

**Position:** Assistant Professor

**Specialization:** Data Science in Population Health

**Role within ELAN:** Coordinator of the Data Competence Center

After completing a Master’s in Astronomy, I obtained my PhD in Leiden and subsequently spent three years as a postdoctoral researcher in the United States. The following ten years, I worked as a data scientist in various industries.

In my current role, I conduct quantitative, interdisciplinary research in population health. The projects differ in scope but usually rely on routine healthcare data. As coordinator of ELAN’s Data Competence Center, I work on strengthening the technical foundation of this infrastructure. The aim is to enable researchers to work faster and more efficiently, and to make analyses more reproducible, findable, and traceable.

In my spare time, I still consider myself an astronomer. Alongside work and family life with four children, I find relaxation in my role as a beer sommelier. I also enjoy abstraction: I like playing the board game Go, preferably on a physical board with stones, and solving logical puzzles.

**Working days:** Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday
