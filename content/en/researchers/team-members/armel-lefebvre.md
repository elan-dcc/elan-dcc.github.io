# Dr. Armel E.J.L. Lefebvre

**Position:** Postdoctoral researcher

**Specialization:** Data management

**Role within ELAN:** Member of the Data Competence Center

After completing my Masterâ€™s in Information Science at Utrecht University, I obtained my PhD on Research Data Management for Open Science. During my doctoral research, I gained extensive experience in research data management, with a focus on reproducibility and data accessibility. Later, as a postdoc at Tsinghua University in China, I developed software to make bioinformatics data analysis more accessible.

I am currently a researcher at the Health Campus The Hague and Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS), where I combine my expertise in data management, research evaluation, and open science to improve the reproducibility of ELAN data. In addition, I contribute to the ELAN Data Competence Center by working on innovative data science applications to support population health management researchers.

Outside of research, I enjoy drawing, programming small projects on my computer, doing DIY projects at home, and going on long walks.

**Working days:** Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
