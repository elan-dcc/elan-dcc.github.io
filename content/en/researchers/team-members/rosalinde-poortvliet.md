# Dr. Rosalinde K.E. Poortvliet

**Position:** Associate Professor

**Specializations:** Appropriate care for the elderly; patient-centered research in primary care

**Role within ELAN:** Member of the core committee and of the steering committee

After studying Biomedical Sciences and Medicine, I completed my training as a general practitioner in Leiden. Since my doctoral research, my focus has been primarily on optimizing medical treatments for the elderly, with a particular emphasis on primary care. From there, I have been involved as a project leader in various (intervention) studies on cardiovascular medication and levothyroxine in elderly patients, as well as patient-centered research on osteoporosis and crisis situations in the elderly.

As a general practitioner, I work in Zevenhoven, where in addition to providing care in the 'regular' practice, I also offer primary care services within Ipse de Bruggen.

Together with my family (husband and two daughters), I live in Kudelstaart. I enjoy spending time outdoors with my girls and love cooking for my family, as well as for larger gatherings. When it comes to vacation, I now prefer to stay closer to home, as there is so much to explore within the Netherlands and Europe. I do prefer it to be sunny, though.

**Working Days:** Tuesday, Friday
