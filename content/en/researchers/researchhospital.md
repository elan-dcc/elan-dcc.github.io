# Accessing Hospital Data from Contracted Hospitals

Research can request and mine hospital data from the contracted hospitals, [Haga Hospital](https://www.hagaziekenhuis.nl/) and [HMC Hospital](https://www.haaglandenmc.nl/english/), through ELAN. Follow these steps to access the data:

## Requesting New Data:
If you need data or variables not currently in ELAN, contact Frank Ardesch. This will take considerably more time than using data already in the research infrastructure, as this requires approval form the hospital board(s).

## Using Free Text for Data/Text Mining:
If you want to use free text to perform your own data/text mining, you can contact the following people:
- Jan Pronk, head of IT
- HAGA: Coen Dortmond
- HMC: Wetenschapsbureau Landsteiner
- Hands-on expert: Janet Kist

If you want permission to use data already available in the ELAN environment, follow the steps laid out below.

## Accessing hospital data in ELAN
Follow these steps to use data already available in the ELAN environment. **Start early to ensure you have enough time to match with a Principal Investigator (PI)**. You can always submit the required files for step 3 later down the line.

1. Find a Principal Investigator (PI) from Haga/HMC willing to co-author your research. Most departments at HAGA have a research nurse to help you contact a PI (step 2).
1. Contact the PI

    - For Haga: Create an account in Haga's [Castor SMS](https://haga.castorsms.com/user/login) and fill in the neccesary forms. Some examples of filled forms can be found [here](https://hagawetenschapsbureau.nl/); 
    - For HMC: Create an account in HMC's [PaNaMa](https://www.haaglandenmc.nl/over-ons/opleiding-en-ontwikkeling/leerhuis-landsteiner/)

1. Complete the forms required by the hospital(s). Make sure **you indicate in the title that it's an ELAN data research request if that's the case to expedite processing**. Include your research protocol and the nWMO approval in your Castor/PaNaMa file.
    
    - **Ensure** you mention that your relies on data already present in ELAN and does not require new data from the hospital(s).
    - **Ensure** you upload the neccesary contracts. For assistance, contact Frank Ardesch or the Health Campus Den Haag secretariat.

1. While your application(s) is/are being processed, make sure to contact an employee from each hospital you're contacting to establish a budget.
1. When your file is complete, the science bureau(s) will process your submission. You will receive a message through Castor and/or PaNaMa when it has been approved.

## Adding an Intern to an Approved Project:
If you want to add an intern to a project that has already been approved by one or both hospitals, do the following:
- For Haga: add the intern's data to Castor SMS and mail Haga wetenschapsbureau.
- For HMC: Contact wetenschapsbureau Landsteiner
