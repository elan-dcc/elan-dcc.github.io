# About the Data at CBS
At the server of CBS [microdata](https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/onze-diensten/maatwerk-en-microdata/microdata-zelf-onderzoek-doen/catalogus-microdata) is available to you. Depending on the project, you may also have access to [General Practitioner Data](https://elan-dcc.github.io/researchers/internal/gp_data/ "General Practitioner Data").

We strongly recommend researchers review the {{< link type="codebookCBS" text="codebook">}} for guidance. Additional information on challenges and potential solutions can be found <a href = "https://github.com/elan-dcc/org/blob/main/QandA.md" target="_blank" alt="Q and A">here</a>.

## Drives
To analyse data within the external environment at CBS, there are only 4 drives of interest, namely the F, G, H and K drive. These drives are explained below.

{{< drive_explainer drive="F:" title="Export" >}}
Used exclusively for exporting aggregated results. More details can be found <a href="../exporting_data">here</a>.
{{< /drive_explainer >}}

{{< drive_explainer drive="G:" title="Data" >}}
Contains all microdata files accessible to researchers.  Files accessible to you are listed in the codebook. Contact the ELAN data manager to request access to additional data.
{{< /drive_explainer >}}

{{< drive_explainer drive="H:" title="Analysis" >}}
This Shared Workspace is where all active researchers perform their analyses. Each researcher has a personal directory. TO optimise storage, delete unecessary files and zip files for short-term storage. Some project data, such as <a href="https://elan-dcc.github.io/researchers/internal/gp_data/" alt="General Practitioner data">general practicioner data</a>, is stored here.
{{< /drive_explainer >}}

{{< drive_explainer drive="K:" title="Metadata" >}}
Houses metadata that explains the data on the G drive. Familiarise yourself with these files first, or visit <a href="https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/onze-diensten/maatwerk-en-microdata/microdata-zelf-onderzoek-doen/catalogus-microdata" target="_blank">this link</a>.

## Data availability
Researchers have access to various data sources within the CBS external environment. Some data is provided by Statistics Netherlands. The Dutch data catalogue can be found [here](https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/onze-diensten/maatwerk-en-microdata/microdata-zelf-onderzoek-doen/catalogus-microdata), though not all files are available for every project. The codebook lists accessible files for each project.

For access to additional files, contact {{< person who="external" >}}. Note that new data from hospitals, The Hague municipality, and general practitioners are uploaded at the beginning of each calendar year. The update frequency for external data sources such as Perined, Parnassia, GGD, and Hadoks has not been established.
