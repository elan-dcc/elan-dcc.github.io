## ELAN Data Competence Center (ELAN-DCC)
The Data Competence Center of ELAN is one of the core teams. This is the team that concerns itself with the technicalities of the data infrastructure(s). Data managers and people who perform data engineering tasks (typically our data managers as well) work in this team, but there are also data scientists and people with skills around visualization and dashboarding, may you need further assistance with that.

## ELAN Research Committee
The ELAN Research Committee, also referred to as the ELAN core committee,  is responsible for coordinating all research requests submitted via [the ticketing system](https://www.elanresearch.nl). The committee facilitates communication with applicants and, in cases where GP data is requested, liaises with the GP Steering Committee for review and approval. Additionally, the ELAN Research Committee oversees communication and procedural workflows, while managing relationships with GPs and other stakeholders.

## ELAN GP Steering Committee
The GP Steering Committee conducts a monthly review of all data requests to ensure the quality, impact, and relevance of research involving ELAN GP data. This committee includes GP representatives from the region, alongside members of the ELAN Research Committee, to provide comprehensive oversight and maintain high standards of research integrity.

## ELAN Scientific Board
The ELAN Scientific Board (SB) is responsible for maintaining the quality of research
conducted within ELAN. The SB utilises a work package structure,
categorising work packages into clinical (e.g., Type 2 diabetes) and
methodological (e.g., Advanced Data Science) areas. Each Work package is represented
by one or more Principal Investigators( PIs), who are integral members of the SB.

The primary objective of the SB meetings is to ensure that all PIs are informed 
about the scientific activities within ELAN, facilitating knowledge sharing and 
preventing overlap. All scientific outputs (including publications and reports) 
must be submitted to the SB for approval. Furthermore, the SB oversees matters 
related to scientific integrity and Open Science. The SB convenes every six weeks, 
but scientific publications can be approved via email within two weeks.


## PHEG Science Committee
The PHEG Science Committee ensures the quality of research at PHEG and evaluates 
proposals based on their scientific content, relevance and feasability. Click [here]({{< relref "sciencecommittee" >}} "PHEG Science Committee") for more information on the PHEG Science Committee.
