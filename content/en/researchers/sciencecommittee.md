# Obtaining approval from the PHEG Science Committee

The PHEG Science Committee ensures the quality of the department's research and evaluates research protocols based on their scientific quality, relevance and feasibility. 

## Submission requirements

For review, submit the following documents (in Word) to the PHEG Science Committee (email Wetenschapscommissie_PHEG@lumc.nl):
- [Application Form for the Research Protocol](https://www.lumc.nl/siteassets/over-het-lumc/afdelingen/pheg/bestanden/application-form-pheg-science-committee-version-21-09-2023-translated-23-08-24.pdf)
- Final protocol (C1)
- [Non-WMO submission letter (A1 Niet-WMO aanbiedingsbrief, template only available in Dutch)](https://www.metc-ldd.nl/niet-wmo-en-niet-mdr-documenten)
- [Non-WMO questionnaire (B2 Niet-WMO vragenlijst, template only available in Dutch)](https://www.metc-ldd.nl/niet-wmo-en-niet-mdr-documenten)

On behalf of the PHEG science committee, members of the ELAN-research team will review and provide their advice by filling in an [ELAN-specific checklist](https://www.lumc.nl/siteassets/over-het-lumc/afdelingen/pheg/bestanden/checklist-advice-protocol-pheg-wecie-elan-data-version-17-04-2023-translation-23-8-24.pdf). The Science Committee will then communicate their final decision to the researcher.

Next step (see [flowchart](https://elan-dcc.github.io/researchers/overview_getting_started/)) is to submit all documents (A1, B2, C1) and the letter of approval (K1) to the nWMO-committee of division 3: see www.metc-ldd.nl/indienen-niet-wmo-en-mdr. Once you have received the WMO exception letter from the nWMO-committee, upload this letter and the final protocol to your ticket at www.elanresearch.nl.

*We are working on simplifying this evaluation process!*

## Background
Every department of the LUMC has its own Science Committee, and the designated medical ethics committee is the METC-Leiden Den Haag Delft (www.metc-ldd.nl). 

A research project that (solely) uses retrospective patient data (like ELAN) is exempt from the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO). In that case, the METC-LDD will not review the protocol. Instead, the non-WMO-committee of your division (div-3) will provide a WMO exception letter. Be aware that sometimes, when multiple datasets are linked together, a research project may fall under the WMO, and it needs to be submitted to the METC-LDD. In all cases (WMO and non-WMO), you need to have letter of approval from the Science Committee.

To get your research published, many (medical) journals request a confirmation/letter of approval from a medical ethics committee. That is why we advise you to submit any research intended for publication for review by the Science Committee, including research with ELAN-data. Of note, a prerequisite for ELAN-research is to be of 'public interestâ€™, therefore publication of the results is necessary.
