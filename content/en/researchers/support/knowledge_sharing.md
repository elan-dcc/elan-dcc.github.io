# Knowledge Sharing
Research is rarely a solitary pursuit. Challenges become easier to tackle when fellow researchers lend a hand, and exchanging ideas often leads to more efficient, robust outcomes. That’s why we’ve created the **ELAN Knowledge Sharing Meetings**—a dynamic space where researchers, both seasoned and new, can collaborate, ask questions, and share valuable insights.

These biweekly (once every 2 weeks) meetings are a hub for discussions on **data, programming, and healthcare**, providing a unique opportunity to connect with peers, solve problems together, and deepen your expertise in ELAN and programming.

Hosted on our secure SharePoint platform, the ELAN Knowledge Sharing community is accessible to all ELAN researchers with a Microsoft or LUMC account. Whether you’re seeking guidance, offering advice, wanting to presnet (intermediate) results, or simply curious, this community is here to empower and support your journey.
